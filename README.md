# The Bellman-Ford Algorithm

> a simple Bellman-Ford Algorithm implementation in Vanilla JavaScript, where I'm using two classes.

1.  An _Edge class_ which represent an edge object in the graph.
2.  A _Graph class_ which represent the Grpah we're woring on, And contain the Bellman-Ford Algorithm method **( shortestDistance(source))** to find the shortest path from source to all Vertices
